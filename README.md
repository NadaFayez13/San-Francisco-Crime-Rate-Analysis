# San-Francisco-Crime-Rate-Analysis

Crime Analysis in San Francisco: A real-world dataset of crimes occurring in the city of San Francisco was analyzed to identify recurring patterns and the temporal and spatial distribution of crimes. The data included information such as crime type, location, time, and region, enabling the application of data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms for classification and clustering.

Reasons for Selecting the Dataset
This dataset was selected due to its real-world relevance and direct impact on public safety, as well as its richness and structure, allowing for multiple stages of analysis. It also provided a learning opportunity to apply theoretical concepts in practice, particularly regarding the analysis of geographic and temporal data.

Methodology and Challenges
The work included data cleaning, feature extraction, the application of clustering algorithms such as Hierarchical and K-Medoids, and crime classification using a decision tree. The team faced challenges such as data imbalance, time series complexity, and increased dimensionality resulting from encryption. The performance of the models was evaluated using various indicators to ensure the quality of the results.
